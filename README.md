# Regression--ANN-RF-DT-LR
This project aims to predict the price of used cars based on various factors like model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, owner type, engine power, color, seats, and number of doors. We compare multiple machine learning models to determine the best-performing algorithm.  
Machine Learning Models Used:
1. Linear Regression (LR) - Simple and interpretable baseline model.
2. Decision Tree (DT) - Splits data based on feature importance.
3. Random Forest (RF) - An ensemble of multiple decision trees for better accuracy.
4. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) - A deep learning model to capture complex patterns.
